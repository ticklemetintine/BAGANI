But before those, you have to prepare yourself by gaining knowledge about your region and the lands beyond. I urge you to learn as much since I’ll be sending you questions daily to test your knowledge.</p><p>Your efforts in enriching your understanding of Sansinukob will be rewarded with badges. There are many badges to collect—refer to your Journal for more information on what you need to do to unlock these.</p><p>And while I may be your guide, you can also turn to others. Click on the chat function to talk to your fellow tribe members or even the members of other tribes. If you need my guidance, click on the help function.</p><p>This is only the beginning. The real challenges will arrive soon.<br>Take this time to know more about the world and to prepare for what’s coming.</p>"
